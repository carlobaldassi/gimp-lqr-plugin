Description: GIMP Liquid Rescale plugin
 This GIMP plugin is a front-end to the LiquidRescale
 library (lqr), which is a free implementation of the
 "seam carving for content-aware image resizing"
 algorithm by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir.
 .
 It aims at resizing images non-uniformly while
 preserving their features. It can also be used
 to remove portions of the picture in a consistent
 way.
 .
